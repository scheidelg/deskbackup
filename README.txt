The root directory holds the root website files.  Nothing should be stored here except core files:

 - content that is distributed with MDwiki and has to be at the root directory
 
 - core add-on files that apply to the entire site (e.g.,  CSS files)
 
 - files needed to present the content via GitHub Pages (e.g., the CNAME file)
