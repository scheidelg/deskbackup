# Exercises and Challenges

This is a collection of information technology and information security exercises and challenges created to test and hone the reader's skills.  Generally a question or scenario is presented, perhaps along with some information about resources that might be used or hints.  A solution is then provided, perhaps with a discussion or walk-through.  Sometimes a series of questions are presented around a single scenario, generally building in complexity and difficulty.

There's a fine line between an 'exercise' and a 'challenge'.  I tend to use 'exercise' (or sometimes 'lab') to refer to a well-defined scenario with a specific set of objectives that should be met to practice or illustrate a specific tool or technology.  Generally the exercise will be built around the idea that the reader will take specific steps to meet the objectives - but hopefully allowing for a bit of freedom for creativity and alternate approaches ([TIMTOWTDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_more_than_one_way_to_do_it), after all).

I tend to use 'challenge', on the other hand, to refer to questions or puzzles that are more free-form in how they can be answered or solved; are intended to challenge the reader's technical or critical thinking skills; and are often intended to hone the reader's ability to use specific techniques, tools, or commands.

## Homegrown

My intent is that the wiki site [http://challenges.scheidel.net]() will contain a collection of exercises and challenges that I've created either myself or in collaboration with others.  I'll keep adding to this over time - starting with trying to pull together and decipher handwritten from things I threw together on the fly while at work or teaching classes. 

## Cyber Defense NetWars v1

Eric Conrad is the primary author of [Cyber Defense NetWars](https://www.sans.org/netwars/cyber-defense) (CDNW). CDNW "is a defense-focused competition aimed at testing your ability to solve problems and secure your systems from compromise \[which tests\] your skills in Administration, Threat Hunting, Log Analysis, Packet Analysis, Cryptography, and much more" \[see ref #1\].

Since spring of 2018 the SANS Technology Institute (STI) has been using CDNW as a tool for the STI Masters of Science in Information Security Engineering (MSISE) students \[see ref #3\] to prepare for the GIAC Security Expert (GSE) certification \[see ref #4\]. Since the start of that effort, I've been acting as a mentor for the STI MSISE students. This consists of coaching students on how to solve the challenges and answer the questions in the game - via email, phone calls, and twice-weekly web conferences (which is, BTW, is a huge difference from standard NetWars events where one of the harder's parts of the instrutor's job is to bite their tongue and not give help that might give a competitor an unfair advantage).

Partly as a result of that support, I've created hints, tips, and walk-through instructions for every question in the game. I can't publish any of that information while CDNW v1 is actively in use for competitions.  **However**... SANS is currently working on Cyber Defense NetWars v2 - an all new set of challenges and questions - and ran a beta in the first week of March 2020.  I'm waiting for Eric to officially retire CDNW v1 and grant me permission to publish my notes.  As soon as he does, I intend to start posting them on a wiki site [http://cdnwv1.scheidel.net]().  We'll see...

## Additional Resources

There are a vast number of resources on the Web that provide excellent exercices and challenges.  I'll start creating and adding to a reference list here.

(bullet or table format... keep adding to it over time)
