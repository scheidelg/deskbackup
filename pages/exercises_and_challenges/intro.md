# Exercises and Challenges

This is a collection of exercises and challenges relating to information technology and information security, intended to test and hone the reader's skills.  Generally scenario is presented along with one or more questions or objectives, perhaps along with some hints or information about resources. A solution is then provided, perhaps with a discussion or walk-through.

There's a fine line between an 'exercise' and a 'challenge'. I tend to use 'exercise' (or sometimes 'lab') to refer to a well-defined scenario with a specific set of objectives that should be met to practice or illustrate a specific tool or technology. An exercise will generally be more guided and built around specific steps that can be taken to meet the objectives - but hopefully allowing for a bit of freedom for creativity and alternate approaches ([TMTOWTDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_more_than_one_way_to_do_it) \[ref #1\], after all).

I tend to use 'challenge', on the other hand, to refer to questions or puzzles that are more free-form in how they can be answered or solved; are intended to challenge the reader's technical or critical thinking skills; and are often intended to hone the reader's ability to use specific techniques, tools, or commands.

## Homegrown

My intent is that the wiki site [http://challenges.scheidel.net]() will contain a collection of exercises and challenges that I've created either myself or in collaboration with others. I'll keep adding to this over time - starting with trying to pull together and decipher handwritten from things I threw together on the fly while at work or teaching classes. 

## Cyber Defense NetWars v1

Eric Conrad is the primary author of [Cyber Defense NetWars](https://www.sans.org/netwars/cyber-defense) (CDNW). CDNW "is a defense-focused competition aimed at testing your ability to solve problems and secure your systems from compromise \[which tests\] your skills in Administration, Threat Hunting, Log Analysis, Packet Analysis, Cryptography, and much more" \[ref #2\].

Since spring of 2018 the SANS Technology Institute (STI) has been using CDNW as a tool for the STI Masters of Science in Information Security Engineering (MSISE) students \[ref #4\] to prepare for the GIAC Security Expert (GSE) certification \[ref #5\]. Since the start of that effort, I've been acting as a mentor for the STI MSISE students. This consists of coaching students on how to solve the challenges and answer the questions in the game - via email, phone calls, and twice-weekly web conferences (which is, BTW, is a huge difference from standard NetWars events where one of the harder's parts of the instrutor's job is to bite their tongue and not give help that might give a competitor an unfair advantage).

Partly as a result of that support, I've created hints, tips, and walk-through instructions for every question in the game. I can't publish any of that information while CDNW v1 is actively in use for competitions. **However**... SANS is currently working on Cyber Defense NetWars v2 - an all new set of challenges and questions - and ran a beta in the first week of March 2020. I'm waiting for Eric to officially retire CDNW v1 and grant me permission to publish my notes. As soon as he does, I intend to start posting them on the wiki site [http://cdnwv1.scheidel.net]().  We'll see...

## Additional Resources

There are a vast number of resources on the Web that provide excellent exercices and challenges.  I'll start creating and adding to a reference list here.

(bullet or table format... keep adding to it over time)
