# Javascript

## copyObject()

A Javascript function that copies a JavaScript object by performing a deep copy of non-inherited properties, including the ability to retain existing properties of the target object.

See [this blog entry](/pages/blog.md#04/24_-_Shallow_Copy_vs._Deep_Copy,_and_copyObject) for a brief overview of shallow copy vs. deep copy.

Besides the deep copy functionality itself, this code illustrates:

 - iterating through Javascript object properties,

 - manipulating Javascript objects,

 - recursion, and

 - checking for circular recursion.
