# Javascript

## cloneObject()

A Javascript function that clones a JavaScript object by performing a deep copy of non-inherited properties.  I needed this functionality as part of functions I was writing to validate and manipulate application configurations, where those configurations are represented in memory as Javascript objects.  Besides the deep copy functionality itself, this code illustrates:

 - iterating through Javascript object properties,

 - manipulating Javascript objects,

 - recursion, and

 - checking for circular recursion.
