## hexdiff.sh

Compare two files (binary or text) and extract differences using a bit-by-bit (-c=b), nibble-by-nibble (-c=n), or byte-by-byte (-c=B) comparison. The differences are identified by comparing the hexdump of each file.

This is potentially useful to inspect files for content that's been hidden using steganography.
