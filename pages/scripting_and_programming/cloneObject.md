# cloneObject()

While writing functions to validate and manipulate application configurations, where those configurations are represented in memory as Javascript objects, I needed to perform a deep copy of Javascript objects.

See this [blog entry](/pages/blog.md#04/24_-_Shallow_Copy_vs._Deep_Copy,_and_cloneObject) for a brief overview of shallow copy vs. deep copy.

Besides the deep copy functionality itself, this code illustrates:

 - iterating through Javascript object properties,

 - manipulating Javascript objects,

 - recursion, and

 - checking for circular recursion.
